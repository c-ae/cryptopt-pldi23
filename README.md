# CryptOpt Artifact Evaluation 
Thank you very much for evaluating this artifact.

We will need a Linux machine with Docker installed.

Help for installing docker [here, Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker), our convenience script in [./INSTALL_docker.md](./INSTALL_docker.md) or [here, Install Docker Engine Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
    - *Note*: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you are using `snap.io` to install Docker and have permission errors while copying result files. (5 min)

Once Docker is installed successfully, jump to the Getting-Started guide [here](./README_getting_started.md) and then to the step-by-step guide of the full evaluation [here](./README_full.md).
For many steps we have included time estimates in parenthesis for the reviewer's convenience. Those are based on a fresh Ubuntu install of a machine with an Intel i9-13900K and 32GB RAM.
