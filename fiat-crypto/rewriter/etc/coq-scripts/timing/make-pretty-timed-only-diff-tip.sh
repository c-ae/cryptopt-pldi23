# Record the compilation performance of the current tip of the library
# and the previous commit, and compare them, only on the files that
# changed.
#
# USAGE: etc/coq-scripts/timing/make-pretty-timed-only-diff-tip.sh -j<NUMBER OF THREADS TO USE>
#
# This script creates a file ($BOTH_TIME_FILE in
# etc/coq-scripts/timing/make-pretty-timed-defaults.sh) with the
# duration of compilation of each file that is compiled by `make`, as
# well as the total duration, of both the state of the most recent
# commit of the library and the commit hash stored in PREV_COMMIT.
# Any arguments passed to this script are passed along to `make`.
# Argument quoting is NOT preserved.  This script supports multiple
# threads (the `-j<n>` arguments to `make`).
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The performance will be successfully computed even
# if some files in the library fail to compile, so do not use the
# success of this script as an indicator that the library compiles.
#
# This script uses `git checkout` to change states; this script will
# exit if you have staged but uncomitted changes.  The preferred way
# to run this script is:
#
# $ ./etc/coq-scripts/timing/make-pretty-timed-only-diff-tip.sh
# $ (git log -1 --pretty=%B; echo; echo '<details><summary>Timing Diff</summary>'; echo '<p>'; echo; echo '```'; cat ./time-of-build-both.log; echo; echo '```'; echo '</p>'; echo '</details>') | git commit --amend -eF -
#
# This will bring up an editor, where you should edit your commit
# message above the time profile, leaving at least one blank line
# before the table.  You may pass, e.g., -j2 to this script to have it
# use more threads.  You should not exceed the number of cores on your
# machine, or else the timing will not be accurate.
